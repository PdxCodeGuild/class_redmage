Put weight on one of the ends of an Olympic barbell. Make sure that you either place the other end of the barbell in the corner of two walls; or put a heavy object  on the ground so the barbell cannot slide backward.

2.) Bend forward until your torso is as close to parallel with the floor as you can and keep your knees slightly bent.

3.) Now grab the bar with both arms just behind the plates on the side where the weight was placed and put your other hand on your knee. This will be your starting position.

4.) Pull the bar straight up with your elbows in (to maximize back stimulation) until the plates touch your lower chest. Squeeze the back muscles as you lift the weight up and hold for a second at the top of the movement.  Breathe out as you lift the weight. Tip: Use a stirrup or double handle cable attachment by hooking it under the end of the bar.  

5.) Slowly lower the bar to the starting position getting a nice stretch on the lats. Tip: Do not let the plates touch the floor.  To ensure the best range of motion, I recommend using small plates (25-lb ones) as opposed to larger plates (like 35-45lb ones).

Narrow Stance Squats,9,Excellent,Strength,Quadriceps,Barbell,Intermediate,https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/269/Male/m/269_1.jpg,https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/269/Male/m/269_2.jpg,https://artifacts.bbcomcdn.com/exercises-app/1.2.1/img/guide-7.gif,"1.)  This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes.  To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.

2.)  Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.

3.)  Step away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart.  Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).

4.)  Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.

5.)  Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.

6.)  Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Stand erect with your feet hip-width apart, chest out, and shoulders back, maintaining the natural curvature of your spine. Your knees should be unlocked and your hand on your hips. This is your starting position. 

2.)  Take a moderate-length step forward with one foot, descending to a point in which your rear knee approaches the floor without touching, maintaining your body's upright posture. Your front knee should bend about 90 degrees, but for knee health it should not be forward of the vertical plane that extends straight up from your toes. If so, take a slightly longer step.  

3.)  From the bottom position, push back up from your forward foot, bringing it back beside the other. 

4.)  Repeat on the opposite side for the required number of repetitions.

This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes.  To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor.  Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.

2.) Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.

3.) Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).

4.) Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).
