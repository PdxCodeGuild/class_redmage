            <div id ="content"><p>Being a higher ed administrator – particularly an administrator working in technology – you might naturally assume that you are in the business of supplying basic customer services to the people you serve.
                    And, mostly, that is a fair assessment.However, a more accurate portrayal of what higher ed CIOs, CTOs, and CDOs provide might be more cogently defined as constituent services: that is, enabling levels of service that not only address basic requests and needs from your areas of responsibility, but further encourage leaders to become fully engaged advocates for their charges, proactively acting for the good of the group or individual under your leadership.
                    In government, this most often takes the form of an elected official facilitating requests from their constituents: seeking an approval for a project, filling a pothole, or expediting a passport request.
                    In higher ed, successful CIOs do much the same. The job isn’t just much fixing problems (though that is critical) or setting strategic vision (even more…</p>

                        No. You binge watch. You stream.You follow the show’s Twitteraccounts. Lurk their Facebookpages. Troll – or be trolled – on Reddit, and the show’s sub-Reddits.
                        Obsessing over every leak, spoiler, and clue, as to what will occur next in the storyline; divining Instagram and Snapchat feeds like ancient augurs, sifting through entrails, teasing out possible glimpses of things to come.
                        We no longer sit back passively, and absorb.
                        We engage. And we participate.
                        We create podcasts. Create YouTubeChannels. Write blogposts. Follow the latest recaps.
                        Our entertainments are now multivalent experiences; where being unengaged, means being left out.
                        Where FOMO– the fear of missing out – makes – or…</p>
