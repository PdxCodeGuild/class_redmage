            One of the most influential personalities in the history of cinema, 
            Steven Spielberg is Hollywood's best known director and one of the wealthiest 
            filmmakers in the world. He has an extraordinary number of commercially successful 
            and critically acclaimed credits to his name, either as a director, producer or 
            writer since launching the summer blockbuster with Jaws (1975), and he has done more 
            to define popular film-making since the mid-1970s than anyone else.
